            1.	The ball will continue to be played live off all rebound surfaces <br><br>
            2.	The ball may travel above the height of the boards during play.<br><br>
            2.1 If the ball hits the back net, possession will be awarded to the goalkeeper of the defending team to continue play.<br><br>
            2.2 If the ball travels over the pitch net, the ball will be awarded to the goalkeeper of the opposing team (the team that did not kick it out) to resume play. The referee will determine whether the ball made contact with the net or fully passed over it.<br><br>
            3.	When the goalkeeper is in possession of the ball, they may only release it underarm. Kicking from the hands or overarm throws are not permitted. The ball must be released using an underarm motion only. <br><br>
            4.	When the ball travels to one of the corners of the pitch, the nearest player will be given 1 metre clearance from all defenders to play it out. Defenders may remain goal-side but must allow the ball to be played out. If the referee determines that a player is using the corner proximity rule to deliberately delay the game, a free kick will be awarded, and the referee may also issue a yellow card at their discretion. <br><br>
            5.	All tackling infractions are measured against player safety in a cage football environment. Contacting the ball first is not a consideration when resulting contact brings player safety into question. Any player who uses physical contact to force an opponent into the rebound board will concede a free kick, and the referee may also issue a yellow card at their discretion. Referees may determine that an offence surrounding the boards is worthy of a red card with no warning.<br><br>
            6.	Any dissent, abuse, or violent conduct towards officials, opposition, spectators, or Wanderers 5s staff will be met with a red card <br><br>
            7.	Red cards carry an immediate 1 match ban. Any subsequent red card within a season will carry a 3-match ban. Any player receiving 3 red cards in a 12-month period will be banned from the Wanderers 5s for a period of 12 months including venue hire and facility use outside of competitions <br><br>
            8.	Wanderers 5s is an all-weather facility. Matches will go ahead in all conditions with additional breaks given around extreme heat, uniform considerations around cold/rain.<br><br>
            9.	In the event of lightning matches in the first half of play will be delayed for 30 minutes. If matches cannot be resumed, they will be re-scheduled.
            <br><br>
            10.	 Matches in the 2nd half of play interrupted by lightning will have the match result stand from the moment play was halted.<br><br><br>
